# SupplyShare
Web form that can be used to collect information about local emergency supply needs
#Live Demo
Live Demo can be seen at
http://supplyshare.org/
#Implementation
This Repo only consists of the static frontend files. In order to use this you will need to setup your own backend form processing and storage. This can be done via any server-side language or cloud API service such as AWS API Gateway.
Data will then need to be stored in database of your choice.
#Pull Requests
Feel free to fork your own version for your needs. I will be accepting pull requests for usability fixes, accessability updates, performance enhancement, content and copy (The master branch is Bay Area themed content)
